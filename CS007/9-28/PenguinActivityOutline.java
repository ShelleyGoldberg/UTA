/*
This program will ask a user for their name, find out how many penguins they've
met and liked, then calculate the number of penguins at our zoo that we 
expect the user to like. 

To do this, the users name will need to be stored along with variables
for the number of penguins met, number liked, percentage liked, number
in our zoo, and finally number we estimate that they will like. 

The number of penguins in our zoo should be hard coded, but the other values
should be given by the user or calculated
